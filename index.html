            Math is very fun because it tests logic. Math includes different formulas and challenges, and I love to solve them. I use Khan Academy, IXL, and many other math websites to learn math. Math can also lead you to do experiments nobody has ever done before. Math can create innovative ideas, and before you know it, you will be loving math! Math is important to learn because it builds problem-solving skills. I also try to solve math problems mentally. Every person needs to know how to think through problems. Math can help with reasoning, creativity, and thinking. Math is a very good curriculum skill, too. Math always keeps a person busy and ready to solve a challenge. Math is an amazing, fun, challenging, and experimental subject. I love math!

                <p id = "inspireparagraph"> In third grade, we started using a website called IXL. I instantly fell in love with it. IXL has a variety of skills. You can even do the diagnostic to recieve more reccomendations! IXL is a helpful learning experience. The best part is that when you miss a question, it tells you why you missed it and how to get the correct answer! IXL is a very helpful and fun learning time! In addition, I discovered a website called Khan Academy. On Khan Academy, you can learn about anything! For example, grammar, life skills, math, science, and more! Every day, there is a mastery challenge to see if you still remember all of the skills you have learned! Also, the best part is that they give out videos if you need help and then you can do the practices from them! These are my two best favorite websites!</p>
